With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney,\n            George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the\n            rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several\n            musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating\n            classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous\n            popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent\n            years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the\n            ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.\n        </p>\n    "
