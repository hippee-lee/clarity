## Status Palette

:::

:::component-section-level-one

Status colors are aliases for tokens in the global color palette and they provide a range of colors for conveying status information. Our status colors consist of info (default), warning, danger, and success. There are two sets of status colors, primary and secondary statuses.

Primary statuses are used for interactions that should be the users primary attention (button, banner alerts). Secondary statuses are secondary interactions and do not draw as much attention visually (outline button, tag, lighweight alerts).
